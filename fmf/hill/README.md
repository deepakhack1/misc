# fmf-hill

A short GAP script implementing a 3-dimensional Hill cipher over an alphabet with 61 characters. Used to produce and check a cyphertext on a promotional booklet for the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at University of Ljubljana.

As GAP doesn't seem to currently support UTF-8, the accented characters of the Slovenian alphabet were encoded using SLOSCII/YUSCII.

Written in December 2013.
