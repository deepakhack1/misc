# Miscellaneous stuff

This repository collects various stuff I have written since I started my undergraduate studies, and, while it might be interesting or useful, is really too small to have a separate repository. More stuff will be added as I find it.

There is a `LICENSE` file in the root of the repository that is supposed to hold for all projects in the repository - at least those parts I wrote myself. It is a permissice MIT license, so basically you are free to do whatever you want with the code.

Each project has its own branch. I am not currently maintaining any of these projects (at least not actively so), but if you find anything useful and do modifications of your own, I'll be happy to accept a pull request (but please stick to the appropriate branch).

Note that I haven't really tested most of the stuff I've put here for years, so they may be in various states of brokenness. Also, some programs are written in Slovenian (either the user interface, or comments/variable names in the code).
