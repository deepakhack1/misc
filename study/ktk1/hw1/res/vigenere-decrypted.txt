You don't know what you're getting. You're bringing a strange child into your
house and home and you don't know a single thing about him, nor what his
disposition is like, nor what sort of parents he had, nor how he's likely to
turn out. Why? It was only last week I read in the paper how a man and his
wife up west of the island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire
to the house at night, set it on purpose Marilla and nearly burnt them to a
crisp in their beds. And i know another case where an adopted boy used to
suck the eggs they couldn't break him of it. If you had asked my advice in
the matter, which you didn't do, Marilla, I'd have said for mercy's sake not
to think of such a thing. That's what this job's comforting seemed neither to
offend nor to alarm, Marilla. She knitted steadily on, I don't deny there's
something in what you say, Rachel. I've had some qualms myself but Matthew
was terrible set on it. I could see that so I gave in. It's so seldom Matthew
sets his mind on anything, that when he does I always feel it's my duty to
give in. ltvu
