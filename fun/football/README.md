# football.py

Given a double dictionary of arrays of results of matches between pairs of football teams, compute the standings using the UEFA method - that is, consider the standings of matches between teams in question recursively before finally resorting to the goal difference and number of goals scored in all matches.

Includes a function which, given the matches played and the scheduled matches, computes all possible final standings, assuming no more than one goal will be scored in each of the scheduled matches.
